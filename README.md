## Work-Hub

I developed a prototype for a social networking platform where users input their credentials, 
which are stored in the LocalStorage, to access a profile page. On the profile page, an API is 
utilized to fetch and display random user information. This prototype showcases a basic authentication 
system and demonstrates the integration of external data through an API, providing a glimpse 
into the functionality of a social networking application.
